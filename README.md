A simple task manager app created using the Django Rest Framework, Bootstrap for the frontend and PostGreSQL for the database. 
This allows a user to do CRUD operations of a task and allows all the users to see the tasks created by one another, allowing the user who hasn't created the task to only view the tasks others have made.
